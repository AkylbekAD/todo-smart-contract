# Todo smart-contract

This project demonstrates simple Todo application functionality based on blockchain.
Anyone can see information about all tasks and add new ones to do, but only creator of task could complete, edit or delete it.
Task could be completed after deadline, but this would be shown at info.

## You can check or test deployed contract on:

Etherscan - https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0xC30e9c230f782a7A96b8c615f1276564F3d70724#readContract

Alchemy - https://dashboard.alchemyapi.io/apps/45puty0gcf68yci9

To deploy contract at different testnets you have to make your own ```.env``` file with alchemy, private and etherscan api keys.
